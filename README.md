# Twitter UnFav

A script to remove favorited tweets from Twitter for privacy reasons.

To use this script, you first need to [generate a token to access your own account] (https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens)

Then copy config.ini.sample to config.ini and fill in the secrets you got from Twitter.

This script is best run by a cronjob once a day.
